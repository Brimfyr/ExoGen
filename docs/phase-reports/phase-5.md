# Phase 5 report: atmosphere, climate, volatiles and erosion

Status: started 2026-10-31, after Phase 4F's close; sub-phase 5A, climate on every body, under way.

Phase 5 gives the bodies their air, their weather's long average, their volatiles and the processes that wear a surface down: sunlight and the temperature it makes on every body, seas, caps and cold traps from the inventory, rivers, glaciers, wind, dust, sand and the chemistry that colours them. The plan (PLAN.md, Phase 5) runs it as seven sub-phases in order, each with its own gate and review: 5A climate on every body, 5B volatiles, 5C water and ice at work, 5D dust, sand and chemistry, 5E surface physics on every body, 5F Io and Thaumasia, 5G weather and clouds. Mars, Titan and Pluto are its test bodies for the look; an Earth-like and a tidally locked ocean world give the climate its numbers.

The order (2026-10-31), the user taking the recommendations: climate first, since every later stage reads temperature and wind, rather than building only what Mars needs and widening later; the weather model as the last sub-phase with its own gate, since nothing on the surface reads it. The materials grow by what processes make, olivine and evaporites added to the plan's list beside quartz sand (PLAN.md 4.10).

The findings continue Phase 4F's numbering from F234.

## The first milestone: the star's light on any body

5A begins with the sunlight itself, since every temperature after it is read from it. The ice stage knew a latitude's mean as S cos(lat) / pi, the equinox's day with no tilt, and nothing else knew more.

- **F234.** The year's sunlight at any point from one integral of the star's path across the sky: the day's mean through the seasons for a body that spins many times an orbit, the time integral over the repeat for one in an exact spin-orbit resonance, a moon's year and seasons its planet's. Checked against a brute-force integration: the Earth's equator 415.9 W/m² and poles 172.4, Mercury's hot longitudes 2.53 times its warm ones, a locked body's substellar hemisphere, the poles passing the equator above 54° of tilt (Pluto, Miranda).

How it went:

- **A moon's tilt.** A moon locked to its planet had no tilt (`rotation.effective_obliquity` was zero for every locked body), so Titan had no seasons; its tilt to the Sun is its planet's where its orbit lies in its planet's equator. `rotation.obliquity` is now that tilt for every body, and the presets set it: the Galilean moons 3.13°, Saturn's 26.73°, Miranda 97.77°, Charon 119.6°, the Moon its own 1.54°. Triton's orbit, retrograde at 157° to Neptune's equator, precesses in some seven centuries, so its tilt to the Sun swings between 5° and 51° and its year's sunlight is the mean over the swing.
- **Pins noticed.** Mercury's and Venus's presets pin `rotation.mode` free at their observed periods (their spins from tides are not modelled, principle 11); the insolation reads Mercury's 3:2 from the pinned period. Their spins from tides, a resonance's capture and Venus's atmospheric tides, go into 5A's list.
- **The renders.** Nothing reads the field yet: Mercury, Titan, Charon, Mars and Triton rendered at 1,024 px are byte-identical to milestone 140's in albedo, height, units and surface age.
